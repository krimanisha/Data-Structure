Analysis of Algorithms:- Writing different algorithms for a given set of problem and analyzing it in terms of time and space.
-> Algorithms Analysising is very important as it will helps us to use right algorithms for a problem set which will result in saving time and space.

Drawback:- Writing all the algorithms and then analyzing will consume more time. So, Asympotic Algorithms is introduced.

Asympotic Algorithms:- Measuring order of growth of a program or algorithms in terms of input size.

Order of Growth:-
Method 1-
A function f(n) is said to be growing faster than g(n) if -
i) 
ii)

Method 2-
i) Ignore lower order terms
ii) Ignore leading constant

How do we know which terms are lower order?
c < loglogn < logn < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 <n^4 < 2^n < n^n

Asympotic Notation:- 

There are total 3 cases:-
1) Best Case    2) Average Case     3) Worst Case
--> Average Case is impratical to guess.
--> Worst Cases are only considered when there are more than 1 case in algorithm.

Mathematical Notation:-
1) Big O - Represents exact or upper bound.
2) Thetha - Represents exact bound.
3) Omega - Represents exact or lower bound.
